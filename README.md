# URL_Shortener
Shorten your URLs!

This app was made by using Express.js and MongoDB in an attempt to learn more about how backends work. I played around with Vue.js and Tailwind to create the frontend. It stores url's with their unique slugs (autogenerated/not). When a user accesses a particular route, a URL with that particular slug would be returned.

To run:
1. Download the repo
2. Configure environment variables in a .env file. Set your MONGO_URI there.
3. Type NPM start. Your app should run and be ready to go!
